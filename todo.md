Gender in academia - Data visualisation


This was another course work project to learn data visualisation. It uses D3.js (Data Driven Documents) for handling SVG and DC.js (Dimensional Charting) to do the graphing. We did this early in the course when my understanding of JS was not at the level it is today, so while it was fun to build, it wasn't until later that I really started to understand how it worked.
