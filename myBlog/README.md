Todo / planned features

* add ability for users to update their details

Formatting is lost when post are retrieved from the db. why?

* Add an edit post button to the view post page

* ability to make a post sticky so it stays at the top of the post feed

* Do something with the about page... or get rid of it.

* Post replies should show the username of the user who commented

* Sub link to get an email about each new post

* Feature to save draft posts so people don't get emailed every time you write something down

* A personal feed for posts-in-progress / personal notes -- perhaps integrated with drafts. 

* Users should be able to change their details. Optionally add first and last names, and change password with email token

* paginate posts and comments

* post page should have a link to next and previous posts

* users can add fav posts and see a list of favs in their user page

* upvote and downvotes for replies

* dont need a new route for a reply - add it as a replies section below post

* make nav links should be coloured differently if you are currently on that page.

* add an admin page where admins can make other users admins

 --- notes ---

placement of new post button implies it edits the post it sits on.
use new icon rather than edit icon

dont need objectid for all id's 

other routes

/post/reply -- needs to be hooked to db

/post/reply actually doesn't actually need it's own route. replies can be in the post view
