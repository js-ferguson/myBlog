* allow users to be able to dismiss or collapse a sticky post so they don't have to keep seeing it after they have read it

## Notes

Formatting is lost when post are retrieved from the db. why?

placement of new post button implies it edits the post it sits on.
use new icon rather than edit icon

dont need objectid for all id's 

other routes

/post/reply -- needs to be hooked to db

/post/reply actually doesn't actually need it's own route. replies can be in the post view
